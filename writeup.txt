I built an analyst copilot that takes a teaser/CIM blurb, extracts the key deal fields, ranks a buyer universe based on mandate fit and a matching model, and then drafts outreach emails and a teaser-style summary. It also supports buyer search with filters, and tracks the workflow steps and outputs so you can iterate quickly.

What it does
- Deal intake → structured profile (sector, geo, revenue/EBITDA, EV, description)
- Buyer matching with mandate checks (sector/EV/EBITDA bands) + ranked list with “why”
- Outreach automation: email subjects/bodies + deal summary
- Buyer search: keyword + filters to build/validate a buyer list
- Workflow tracking: run history + logs for debugging

It automates the repetitive analyst parts of a sell-side process—intake, buyer list building, and first-pass outreach—so a banker can focus on positioning and relationship work.
